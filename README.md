This was my first actual project with python that was more than printing a few statements. I struggled a little when figuring out how check if the user inputed the coreect data type. It took a few searches, but I eventually figured out how to format everything. I'm very much used to how java and javascript are formated, so the lack of curly brackets felt off to me. It was refreshing to not have to declair what type of variable I was using. Even though it's going to take some time to get used to, I think I going to get the hang of python fairly quickly.
